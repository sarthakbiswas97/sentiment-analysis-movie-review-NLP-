# ðŸŽ¬ Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews (NLP + ML)

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiment.  
It explores multiple text preprocessing methods, feature engineering techniques, and machine learning algorithms to build an effective sentiment analysis pipeline.

## ðŸš€ Features & Concepts Covered

- **Bag of Words (BoW) Model** â€“ represent documents as feature vectors.  
- **Raw Term Frequencies** â€“ *tf(t, d)*: number of times a term appears in a document.  
- **n-Gram Models** â€“ capture contextual meaning beyond single words.  
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)** â€“ weight words by importance.  
- **Text Preprocessing**
  - Tokenization  
  - Stemming vs Lemmatization  
  - Stopword removal  
- **Model Training**
  - Naive Bayes Classifier  
  - Logistic Regression with **L1/L2 regularization**  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - `GridSearchCV`  
  - Regularization strength `C`  
- **Evaluation**
  - Stratified k-fold cross-validation  
- **Scalability**
